Hi,

 I'm reaching out because I'd like to learn more about 'BLANKS' food service operations, and demonstrate how we are a great fit to increase customer satisfaction and drive sales with our specialty snack products.

AgStandard, based in Los Angeles, makes premium snacks designed to meet the needs and desires of todays business and leisure traveler. Our products are available in a variety of formats suitable for applications ranging from cocktail snacks to salad ingredients to minibar items.

May I have the opportunity to share a few samples and see how we can work in tandem to delight your customers and increase sales?

-Notes

- Snack can be used for multiple application.


Some example uses are as cocktail snack, salad ingredient and minibar


Customers from both Los Angeles and New York have consistently told us that too often the snack offerings accompanying premium craft cocktails are uninventive, boring and they would like to see something other than commodity level snacks when paying a premium price for modern beverages.
